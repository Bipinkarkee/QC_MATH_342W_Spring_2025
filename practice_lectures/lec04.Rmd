## First modeling exercise

Before we model, let's fabricate the training data! Let's try to build a data matrix similar to the one in the class example. Let's imagine $n = 100$ and $x_1$ is salary, $x_2$ is a dummy variable for missing loan payment in their credit history, $x_3$ is a ordinal variable for crime type coded 0, 1, 2 or 3.

We can "make up" a dataset using the sampling we just learned.

```{r}
n = 100 #number of historical objects: the people
p = 3 #number of features about each

X = matrix(NA, nrow = n, ncol = p)
X
```

Some more useful matrix functions:

```{r}
nrow(X)
ncol(X)
dim(X)
length(X) #countless bugs!
c(X)
```

Why should we fill up this matrix with NA's? No technical reason; it is done for a practical reason. Every value is currently "missing" until it's filled in i.e. it will let you know if you didn't fill any of the values.

We can also name rows and columns. Each row is a historical person and each column is a feature about that person.

```{r}
colnames(X) = c(
  "salary", 
  "has_past_unpaid_loan", 
  "past_crime_severity"
)
colnames(X) #setter and a getter
fake_first_names = c(
  "Sophia", "Emma", "Olivia", "Ava", "Mia", "Isabella", "Riley", 
  "Aria", "Zoe", "Charlotte", "Lily", "Layla", "Amelia", "Emily", 
  "Madelyn", "Aubrey", "Adalyn", "Madison", "Chloe", "Harper", 
  "Abigail", "Aaliyah", "Avery", "Evelyn", "Kaylee", "Ella", "Ellie", 
  "Scarlett", "Arianna", "Hailey", "Nora", "Addison", "Brooklyn", 
  "Hannah", "Mila", "Leah", "Elizabeth", "Sarah", "Eliana", "Mackenzie", 
  "Peyton", "Maria", "Grace", "Adeline", "Elena", "Anna", "Victoria", 
  "Camilla", "Lillian", "Natalie", "Jackson", "Aiden", "Lucas", 
  "Liam", "Noah", "Ethan", "Mason", "Caden", "Oliver", "Elijah", 
  "Grayson", "Jacob", "Michael", "Benjamin", "Carter", "James", 
  "Jayden", "Logan", "Alexander", "Caleb", "Ryan", "Luke", "Daniel", 
  "Jack", "William", "Owen", "Gabriel", "Matthew", "Connor", "Jayce", 
  "Isaac", "Sebastian", "Henry", "Muhammad", "Cameron", "Wyatt", 
  "Dylan", "Nathan", "Nicholas", "Julian", "Eli", "Levi", "Isaiah", 
  "Landon", "David", "Christian", "Andrew", "Brayden", "John", 
  "Lincoln"
)
rownames(X) = fake_first_names
rownames(X) #setter and getter
X
```

Let's pretend "salary" is normally distributed with mean \$50,000 and standard error \$20,000. Let's make up some data

```{r}
set.seed(1984) #so answers come out the same
X[, 1] = round(rnorm(n, 70000, 10000))
X
#another way to set this feature:
X[, "salary"] = round(rnorm(n, 70000, 10000))
X
```

A quick sidebar about vectors within matrices with row or column names:

```{r}
salaries = X[, 1] 
salaries #it's a vector with names
names(salaries) #access to its names
names(salaries)[3] = "Adam"
salaries
salaries[3]
salaries["Adam"]
sort(salaries)
#how do we sort salaries by name?
salaries[order(names(salaries))]
?order #it's like sort, but it returns indices
rm(salaries)
```

Are the salary values independent? Yes, or at least we assume so... Hopefully we will get to models in this semester where they are not independent.

We will eventually do visualization, but first let's take a look at a summary of this data:

```{r}
summary(X[, "salary"])
```

There are other base functions to know:

```{r}
mean(X[, "salary"]) #mean should be "average"!!
sum(X[, "salary"]) / length(X[, "salary"])
var(X[, "salary"])
sd(X[, "salary"])
median(X[, "salary"])
min(X[, "salary"])
max(X[, "salary"])
IQR(X[, "salary"])
```

There is also the convenient quantile and inverse quantile function

```{r}
quantile(X[, "salary"], probs = 0.5)
quantile(X[, "salary"], probs = c(.1, .9))
inverse_quantile_obj = ecdf(X[, "salary"]) #the "empirical" CDF
inverse_quantile_obj(50000)
inverse_quantile_obj(70000)
inverse_quantile_obj(0)
inverse_quantile_obj(-10000)
inverse_quantile_obj(200000)
```


Let's pretend "has_past_unpaid_loan" is benoulli distributed with probability 0.2

```{r}
X[, "has_past_unpaid_loan"] = rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = 0.2)
X
```

Is this a reasonable fabrication of this dataset? No... since salary and not paying back a loan are dependent r.v.'s. But... we will ignore this now.

It would be nice to see a summary of values. Would median and mean be appropriate here? No. For categorical variables, you should "table" them:

```{r}
table(X[, "has_past_unpaid_loan"])
```


Also, 50\% of people have no crime, 40\% have an infraction, 8\% a misdimeanor and 2\% a felony. Let's try to add this to the matrix. We first need to simulate this. Here's how:

```{r}
X[, "past_crime_severity"] = sample(
  c("no crime", "infraction", "misdimeanor", "felony"),
  size = n,
  replace = TRUE,
  prob = c(.50, .40, .08, .02)
)
X
```

Oh no - what happened?? Our matrix went all characters... The matrix type cannot handle numeric and categorical variables simultaneously! It would be nice to keep factor or character information in a matrix but this is not the spec.

Enter the key data type, the "data.frame" - this is the object that is used for modeling in the R ecosystem. It is essentially an upgraded matrix.

```{r}
X = data.frame(
  salary = round(rnorm(n, 50000, 20000)),
  has_past_unpaid_loan = rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = 0.2),
  past_crime_severity = sample(
    c("no crime", "infraction", "misdimeanor", "felony"),
    size = n,
    replace = TRUE,
    prob = c(.50, .40, .08, .02)
  )
)
rownames(X) = fake_first_names
X
```

RStudio gives us a nicer rendering of the information. You can open it up in a separate tab via:

```{r}
#View(X)
```

and you can view summaries of each feature and data type of each feature via

```{r}
summary(X)
str(X)
```


Again, summary defaults the binary variable "has_past_unpaid_loan" as numeric and "past_crime_severity" as character. We should convert both to factor and try again. Note the "$" operator which is now valid for data.frame objects. It's a getter and a setter!

```{r}
X$has_past_unpaid_loan = factor(X$has_past_unpaid_loan, labels = c("Never", ">=1")) #note the convenient labels
X$past_crime_severity = factor(X$past_crime_severity)
summary(X) #much better now!
```

Here's an even snazzier way of summarizing a data frame:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(skimr)
skim(X) #run this in console - RStudio messes this up by displaying in three inconvenient screens
```

Now that we have two categorical variables, we can do a "cross tab":

```{r}
table(X$has_past_unpaid_loan)
table(X$past_crime_severity)
table(X$has_past_unpaid_loan, X$past_crime_severity) / 100
#to avoid needing the "X$" over and over, use the convenience "with"
with(X,
  table(has_past_unpaid_loan, past_crime_severity)
)
```
Here is a fancier table using a library. Any Stata fans out there?

```{r}
pacman::p_load(gmodels)
CrossTable(X$has_past_unpaid_loan, X$past_crime_severity, chisq = TRUE)
```

In our training set D, we are missing one final variable, the response, y! Let's generate it and say that 90\% of people are creditworthy i.e. they paid back their loan. Note the "$" operator is a getter and a setter and used here as a setter.

```{r}
X$paid_back_loan = factor(rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = 0.85), labels = c("No", "Yes"))
```

Conceptually - why does this make no sense at all??? y is independent of X --- what happens then? No function f can ever have any predictive / explanatory power! This is just a silly example to show you the data types. We will work with real data soon. Don't worry.

Note that our matrix is now no longer just $X$; it includes $y$. I could make a renamed copy, but I want to show off dropping this column and create a new object that's both features and response column-binded together:

```{r}
y = X$paid_back_loan
X$paid_back_loan = NULL #drop column
Xy = cbind(X, y) #an aside: what do you think the "rbind" function does?
head(Xy) #make sure that worked
summary(Xy) #much better now!
```

I prefer calling the full training set ${X, y}$ a data frame called $Xy$ which is synonymous with $D$ from class. 

We should clean up our workspace now. This deletes everything but the Xy object:

```{r}
rm(list = setdiff(ls(), "Xy"))
```

## The Null Model

```{r}
#There's no standard R function for sample mode!!!
sample_mode = function(data){
  mode_name = names(sort(-table(data)))[1]
  switch(class(data),
    factor = factor(mode_name, levels = levels(data)),
    numeric = as.numeric(mode_name),
    integer = as.integer(mode_name),
    mode_name
  )
}

g0 = function(){
  sample_mode(Xy$y) #return mode regardless of x
} 

g0()
```


## The Threshold Model

Let's compute the threshold model and see what happens. Here's an inefficent but quite pedagogical way to do this:

```{r}
n = nrow(Xy)
num_errors_by_parameter = matrix(NA, nrow = n, ncol = 2)
colnames(num_errors_by_parameter) = c("threshold_param", "num_errors")
y_logical = Xy$y == "Yes"
for (i in 1 : n){
  threshold = Xy$salary[i]
  num_errors = sum((Xy$salary > threshold) != y_logical)
  num_errors_by_parameter[i, ] = c(threshold, num_errors)
}
num_errors_by_parameter

#look at all thresholds in order
num_errors_by_parameter[order(num_errors_by_parameter[, "num_errors"]), ]

#now grab the smallest num errors
best_row = order(num_errors_by_parameter[, "num_errors"])[1]
x_star = c(num_errors_by_parameter[best_row, "threshold_param"], use.names = FALSE)
x_star
```

Let's program `g`, the model that is shipped as the prediction function for future `x_*`

```{r}
g = function(x){
  factor(ifelse(x > x_star, "Yes", "No"), levels = c("Yes", "No"))
} 

g(10000)
g(50000)
g(1000)
```


## Matrix operations in R

R can do all the standard matrix operations. Let's go through them quickly. First initialize two example matrices:

```{r}
A = matrix(rep(1, 4), nrow = 2)
A
B = array(seq(1, 4), dim = c(2, 2))
B
I = diag(2) #create an identity matrix of size 2x2
I
```

Now we show off some operations:

```{r}
A * B #element-wise multiplication
A %*% B #matrix multiplication
B %*% I
t(B) #transpose
solve(B)
solve(A) #BOOM - why?

#alternative method - to be wrapped in a function
tryCatch(
  {
    solve(A)
  },
  error = function(e){
    print("matrix not invertible, doing Moore-Penrose generalized pseudoinverse instead...")
    MASS::ginv(A)
  }
)

#how would you wrap this and handle it in the real world?
solve(I)
#rank(A) = 1 #no such function... but... there are tons of add-on libraries for matrix computations e.g.
pacman::p_load(Matrix) #load the Matrix library
rankMatrix(B)
rankMatrix(A)
rankMatrix(I)
```

Note that vectors and matrices are not the same:

```{r}
v = c(1, 2, 3) #3-d vector
t(v) #converts to 1x3 vector... unsure why
t(t(v))
v %*% v #seems to default to dot product
t(v) %*% t(t(v)) #dot product
I = diag(3)
I %*% v #seems to default correctly!
I %*% t(v) #actually non-comformable
```
